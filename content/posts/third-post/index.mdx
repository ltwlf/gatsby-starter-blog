Hello, world! This is a
Welcome! This tutorial guides you through building a full-stack, GraphQL-powered app with the Apollo platform.

We want you to feel empowered to build your own production-ready app with Apollo, so we're skipping "Hello World" in favor of an example that's closer to "Real World", complete with authentication, pagination, testing, and more.

Ready? Let's dive in!

## Example Resolver

```js
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const typeDefs = require('./schema');
const { createStore } = require('./utils');

const resolvers = require('./resolvers');

const LaunchAPI = require('./datasources/launch');
const UserAPI = require('./datasources/user');

const store = createStore();

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,

  resolvers,
  dataSources: () => ({
    launchAPI: new LaunchAPI(),
    userAPI: new UserAPI({ store })
  })
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ğŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```
